# Bantumi-MinMaxAndNot
This software allows you to play Bantumi against the computer  applying mainly two different functions AI.

The file *f_ia_bantumi_MinMax.cpp* includes functions of Min-Max while *f_ia_bantumi_NoMinMax.cpp* implements a function of probability.

By default the main file Bantumi.cpp implements the file f_ia_bantumi_MinMax.cpp, so if you want to try the probability function you must change the row **#include "f_ia_bantumi_MinMax.cpp"** to **#include "f_ia_bantumi_NoMinMax.cpp"** at line 32.
